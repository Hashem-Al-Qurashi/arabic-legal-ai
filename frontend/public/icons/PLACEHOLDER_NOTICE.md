# ‚ö†Ô∏è PLACEHOLDER ICONS NOTICE

## üé® **Temporary Icons**

The following placeholder files need to be replaced with proper app icons:

### **Currently Using:**
- All icon sizes are using SVG placeholder
- Not optimized for PWA installation
- Generic appearance on home screen

### **Action Required:**
1. **Design proper icons** following the specifications in `ICON_REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. **Replace all placeholder files** with proper PNG icons
3. **Test installation** on different devices

### **Quick Fix for Testing:**
You can use online tools to generate basic icons:
1. Go to https://tools.crawlbase.com/tools/pwa-icon-generator
2. Upload a 512x512 base image
3. Download all sizes
4. Replace files in this directory

### **Priority Icons for Basic PWA:**
- `icon-192x192.png` - Required for Android
- `icon-512x512.png` - Required for splash screen
- `icon-180x180.png` - Apple touch icon

**üö® PWA will work with placeholders but won't look professional on users' home screens!**
